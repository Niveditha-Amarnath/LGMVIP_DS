# Image to Pencil Sketch with Python


- Read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. 

- This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo.

- The next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. 
 
- Inversion can be used to enhance details. 

- Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. 

- This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image.
